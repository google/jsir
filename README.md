# JSIR - Next Generation JavaScript Analysis Tooling

JSIR is a next-generation JavaScript analysis tool. At its core is an
[MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org)-based high-level
[intermediate representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_representation),
which supports both
[dataflow analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-flow_analysis) and
lossless conversion back to source. This unique design makes it suitable for
source-to-source transformation.

## Use cases at Google

JSIR is used at Google for analyzing and detecting malicious JavaScript files,
protecting products like Ads, Android, and Chrome. Some example use cases are:

*   **Signal extraction**

    JSIR is used for extracting syntactical and behavioral signals, which are
    fed into downstream security systems.

*   **[Taint analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taint_checking)**

    JSIR is used for detecting suspicious information flows, by utilizing its
    dataflow analysis capability.

*   **Decompilation**

    JSIR is used for decompiling the
    [Hermes](https://github.com/facebook/hermes) bytecode all the way to
    JavaScript code, by utilizing its ability to be fully lifted back to source
    code.

*   **Deobfuscation**:

    JSIR is used for deobfuscating JavaScript by utilizing its source-to-source
    transformation capability.

    See our latest [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17691) on how we combine
    the Gemini LLM and JSIR for deobfuscation.

## Design highlights

Driven by the diverse use cases of malicious JavaScript analysis and detection,
JSIR needs to achieve two seemingly conflicting goals:

*   It needs to be **high-level** enough to be lifted back to the AST, in order
    to support source-to-source transformation and decompilation.

*   It needs to be **low-level** enough to facilitate dataflow analysis, in
    order to support taint analysis, constant propagation, etc..

To achieve these goals, JSIR defines two dialects:

*   **JSHIR:**

    This is a high-level IR that uses MLIR regions to accurately model control
    flow structures.

*   **JSLIR:**

    This is a low-level IR that uses CFGs to represent branching behaviors.
    JSLIR adds extra operations to annotate the kind of original control flow
    structures. This allows JSLIR to be fully converted back to JSHIR.

## Getting started

### Install build tools

We have only tested `clang` on Linux:

```shell
# Install clang:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install clang
```

We use the `Bazel` build system. It is recommended to use `Bazelisk` to manage
`Bazel` versions:

```shell
# Install Bazelisk through npm:

sudo apt install npm
sudo npm install -g @bazel/bazelisk
```

### Build

Note: The build takes a lot of storage space. If you run out of space, Bazel
will return a cryptic error.

LLVM takes a long time to fetch and build. We can test if LLVM is properly
included by building a part of it:

```shell
# This will fetch LLVM and build its support library:

bazelisk build @llvm-project//llvm:Support
```

To build JSIR:

```shell
# Build everything:
bazelisk build //...

# Or, build a single target:
bazelisk build //maldoca/js/ir:jsir_gen

# Or, build all targets in a directory:
bazelisk build //maldoca/js/ir/...
```

### Test

To run test cases:

```shell
# Run all tests:
bazelisk test //...

# Or, run a specific test:
bazelisk test //maldoca/js/quickjs:quickjs_test

# Or, run all tests under a directory:
bazelisk test //maldoca/js/ir/conversion/...
```

### Run the `jsir_gen` tool

Convert a JavaScript source file to JSHIR:

```shell
bazelisk run //maldoca/js/ir:jsir_gen --\
    --input_file=$(pwd)/maldoca/js/ir/conversion/tests/if_statement/input.js \
    --passes=source2ast,ast2hir
```
